# Goaquarium

A half-implmented Asciiquarium port.  Missing a lot of fish and the ability to actually fish (point-and-click drop fishing line for a fish).  Other than that, it is ready to be embedded in your Golang apps as an easter egg.  Also see my implmentation of [Steam Locamotive](https://github.com/ansoni/gosl)
